1) Do you have production experience with Node prior to the submission of this code challenge? If yes, for how long?
2) DO you have production experience with React prior to the submission of this code challenge? If yes, for how long?

Answer:
  
   To answer both the questions, I did not have any production experience with Node or React. I started educating myself when
   I received the coding challenge, over the weekend I was able to grasp good knowledge for designing and developing in React.
   This coding challenge was quite interesting and it pushed me to learn the basics, architecture and working of both Node and React.
   I was able to successfully develop and satisfy the requirements of the coding challenge. I enjoyed working on this challenge very mych.
